          <h4>About me</h4>
          <p>Until I started teaching myself programming, I was going give up everything and live off the grid. I'm not being dra-MATT-ic; I'm just that outdoorsy.<span class="aboutHidden"><br><br>Click here to read more...</span></p>
          <p><span class="aboutShowing">Foraging mushrooms is my favorite weekend activity when the rainy season hits Oregon. My beautiful girlfriend and I are learning how to find new locations like a couple of Old Russians. We are able to gather enough, at times, to sell! My girlfriend thinks I'm going to buy her a diamond ring with the money but my jeep needs a roofrack, bigger tires, and new sound system. She said she doesn't even diamonds so I'll probably just take her to Richardson's Rock Ranch and let her pick out a Thunderegg and call it a day.<br>Which brings me to my second favorite activity: Rock Hounding. The Earth has beautiful gifts to offer and rocks are free. I love jasper, agates, and obsidian. I've collected crystals ranging from augites to zeolites. But my favorite is the Petoskey. I was born in Petoskey, Michigan. The Petoskey Stone is the State Rock of Michigan. From the moment I was born, I knew I wanted to collect rocks and name my son Petoskey. (Don't tell my girlfriend--I'm not sure if we're there yet.)<br>Also don't tell her that I didn't write the following:<br>"Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters.” ― Norman Maclean, A River Runs Through It<br>Just like Norm, I am a fisherman. I've fished the Wilson, The Willamette, The Rogue, The Sandy, The Klickitat, Hood River, even the Columbia but my favorite is the Deschutes. The Deschutes is my Big Blackfoot River. If you want to know more about me, invite me to go fishing.</span></p>
